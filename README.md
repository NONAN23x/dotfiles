Setting Up my workflow in a jiffy :)

### Mostly Hyprland related stuff, you won't get enough from here if you are on a Desktop Environment, get better, use arch. Because [arch is the best](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/arch_is_the_best)

### Software requirements/dependencies
Install these first
```
paru -S hyprland-git kitty waybar-hyprland-git swww swaylock-effects wofi wlogout mako xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland-git swappy grim slurp thunar pamixer pavucontrol brightnessctl network-manager-applet gvfs thunar-archive-plugin file-roller pacman-contrib ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd noto-fonts-emoji lxappearance xfce4-settings --needed
```
The above dependencies assume that you already have a working and configured Arch Linux system, with atleast one Wayland Deksotp Environment or Window Manager configured. (Either first install KDE or Sway as a base idiot)


### paste all the folders inside `~/.config/`
### paste contents of scripts folder inside `~/.scripts/`
Like what? Im busy to create a setup script for you! 

### Credits
Thanks to [@linuxmobile](https://github.com/linuxmobile) for some of the configs that I use
